# Zack's String Physics Tests
A space with version control for me to test some theories on how to replicate string physics. This is for a specific project, but the code could be applied elsewhere.

## Stack
**TODO**: Complete this list with the libraries for physics and rendering.
- Node
- Express

## To Do
- Create repository, set up project space
- Find some libraries to test out (focus on SVG)
- Create the building blocks
    - Connected vertices
    - Gravity
    - Elasticity
    - Repulsion (balls)
- Connect the blocks together
- Initial animations
- User interaction (add subtasks)
- Update readme documentation
- Abstract and pull into other project
